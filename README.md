# LinnworksTrackingFix
Fixes an issue with Linnworks currently (as of 22/09/2020), where the tracking information is not included in the shipping email from Magento. This is due to an improper implementation on the API and is currently on their low/medium priority list to be fixed (whenever that may be).
